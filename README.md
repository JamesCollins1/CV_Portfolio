# Welcome to my Porfolio Repository

This is just a placeholder while I am creating my portfolio website. It currently contains my CV, my AI bot that will play the game MicroRTS (written in Java), my server and client with a database incorporated for my multiplayer MUD (written in C#) and the link (see below) to my google drive folder containing my game project for this year (written in C++ and blueprints).
